### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a code sorcerer who weaves code like a wizard casts spells. I love games and art, and my languages of choice are JavaScript and Haxe.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
  - A library of tools and plugins for [RPG Maker MZ](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-mz) & MV with the team [@LunaTechsDev](https://github.com/LunaTechsDev).
    - [Luna Tea](https://github.com/LunaTechsDev/LunaTea)
    - [Luna Tea Napkin](https://github.com/LunaTechsDev/LunaTeaNapkin)
    - [Luna Website](https://github.com/LunaTechsDev/lunatechsdev.github.io) & [Server](https://github.com/LunaTechsDev/luna-server)
    - & more!
  - [LTN Games](https://ltngames.xyz) - A small indie game development studio creating games and resources for everyone. While initally started as a hobby project by myself. it has since grown to be a bit larger with some close friends and family who joined, so, I guess you could say its a family indie game studio.
  - [FenixEngine](https://fenixengine.xyz) an open source project created in hopes to make plugin development easier and with ES6 modules. This project will soon be merged with the many projects over at [@LunaTechsDev](https://github.com/LunaTechsDev)
